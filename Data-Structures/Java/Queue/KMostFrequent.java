/* Given an array of N numbers and a positive integer K. 
The problem is to find K numbers with the most occurrences, i.e., 
the top K numbers having the maximum frequency. If two numbers 
have the same frequency then the number with a larger value 
should be given preference. The numbers should be displayed in 
decreasing order of their frequencies. It is assumed that the 
array consists of at least K numbers. */
